    "\n",
    "1. **Enhance the Q-Learning Agent**:\n",
    "   - Extend the state representation to incorporate the full wind field (not just local wind)\n",
    "   - This would allow the agent to anticipate wind changes and plan better routes\n",
    "   - Hint: Modify the `discretize_state` method to extract and process relevant features from the flattened wind field\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithmic Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Implement function approximation to handle continuous state spaces better\n",
    "   - Explore other RL algorithms like SARSA, Expected SARSA, or Deep Q-Networks\n",
    "   - Experiment with different exploration strategies that adapt over time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Physics-Based Approaches**:\n",
    "   - Leverage your understanding of sailing physics (from challenge_walkthrough notebook)\n",
    "   - Implement rule-based algorithms or path planning (A*, etc.) that take advantage of domain knowledge\n",
    "   - Create hybrid approaches that combine RL with domain-specific rules"
